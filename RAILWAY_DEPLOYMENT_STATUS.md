## 🔧 Actions Taken

1. ✅ **Verified local code** - Payment options are present in `Payment.js`
2. ✅ **Pushed to remote** - All changes pushed to GitHub
3. ✅ **Forced Railway rebuild** - Ran `railway up` command
4. ❌ **Tested production** - Payment options still missing

## 🚨 Root Cause

**Railway is serving an OLD cached version** of the application, not the latest commit from main branch.

### Possible Reasons:
1. **Build Cache** - Railway might be using cached build artifacts
2. **Deployment Delay** - Build might still be in progress
3. **Branch Mismatch** - Railway might be deploying from a different branch
4. **Build Failure** - Recent build might have failed silently

## 📋 Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Clear Railway Build Cache (Recommended)
```bash
# In Railway Dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to "Build Settings"
3. Clear build cache
4. Trigger a new deployment
```

### Option 2: Force Fresh Deployment
```bash
# Make a small change to trigger rebuild
git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger: Force Railway fresh deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Check Railway Build Logs
1. Visit the Railway dashboard
2. Check the latest build logs
3. Verify if the build completed successfully
4. Check for any errors in the build process

### Option 4: Manual Railway CLI Deployment
```bash
railway up --detach
